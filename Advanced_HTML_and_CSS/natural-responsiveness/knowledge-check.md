# Natural Responsiveness

1. Why should you avoid fixed width?

It doesn't allow elements to shrink to fit the screen.

2. Why should you avoid fixed height?

It doesn't allow containers to grow to fit the contents,
causing them to overflow.

3. In what situations might it be appropriate to use a fixed height or width?

The smaller the width, the more reasonable to expect them to be fixed, such
as icons. Height should never be fixed expect maybe for headers and footers.

4. Why should you avoid percentages?

For full heights and/or widths, they are fine, but they should be avoided
for text because they can cause other spacings to change as well (even if
unintended).
