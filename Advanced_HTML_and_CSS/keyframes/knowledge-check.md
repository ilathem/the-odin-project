# Keyframes

1. What are the long and short-hand notations for CSS animations?

Long notations;
`animation-delay`
`animation-direction`
`animation-duration`
`animation-fill-mode`
`animation-iteration-count`
`animation-name`
`animation-play-state`
`animation-timeline`

Short Notation:
`animation: duration | easing-function | delay |
iteration-count | direction | fill-mode | play-state | name `

2. How do you add keyframes to an animation?

By adding more percent parts to the keyframes.

3. When would you use an animation over a transition (and vice versa)?

Use an animation when you need more fine grain control over the
middle states of the animation or when it's infinite, use a
transition when it's just one move with a definite beginning and end.
