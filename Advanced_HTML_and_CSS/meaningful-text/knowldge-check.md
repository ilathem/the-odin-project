## Meaningful Text

1. What are three rules you should follow in order to provide meaningful links?

Text content of the anchor tag should be brief and describe where it goes,
if it is a file, it should tell type and size, and if it opens a new tab or
window, this should be indicated.

2. What information should you inform users of in order to provide meaningful error messages in forms?

Where the error is, what caused it, and how to fix it.

3. When should you use the empty string/null value for the alt attribute?
