# Media Queries

1. How do you define a media query to create a mobile layout for your site?

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    margin: 8px;
  }
}
```

2. What is the difference between max-width and min-width in a media query definition?

`max-width` is everything up to that value, and `min-width` is everything past that value.
